## ⚙️ Agent Workflow DAG
<img width="1374" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-01 at 1 37 58 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/437e4782-0b12-4c77-b759-8c49cc1f9e0b" />

### Core Components
- **Core Agent**: Coordinates state, logic, and next steps
- **Tool Node**: Executes external tools (coping strategies, calculations)
- **Specialized Tools**:
  - `alcohol_calculator`
  - `trigger_detector`
  - `stress_coping`
  - `social_pressure_coping`
  - `boredom_coping`
  - `default_coping`

### Workflow Steps
1. Starts with Core Agent receiving user input
2. If needed, Core Agent calls a tool via Tool Node
3. Tool returns result → Core Agent processes it
4. Based on result, agent either:
   - Calls another tool
   - Updates state
   - Ends conversation

### Example
> User: *“I’m feeling stressed after work and thinking about drinking…”*  
- Core Agent detects risk  
- Calls `trigger_detector` → returns `"stress"`  
- Core Agent then calls `stress_coping` tool  
- Returns a coping strategy and updates the user with empathy
